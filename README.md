# Kinematics and Dynamics of a Kuka IIWA Robot Arm
In this exercise I study, the Kinematics and Dynamics of the Kuka WIIA Robot arm. <br>

This project is broken down into three major aspects
1. [Forward Kinematics](/Forward_Kinematics/)
2. [Inverse Kinematics](/Inverse_Kinematics/)
3. [Dynamics](/Dynamics/)

I have a dedicated Jupyter Notebook for each and you can refer my approach to solving these problems accordingly.
